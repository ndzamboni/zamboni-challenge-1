#Project Name: Zamboni Challenge 1
##Overview:
This project aims to ensure that the codebase for the marketing agency website adheres to accessibility standards. By following these standards, we optimize our website for search engines, enhance user experience, and ensure inclusivity for all visitors.

##User Story:
As a marketing agency, we want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

##Acceptance Criteria:
Semantic HTML Elements:

When viewing the source code, ensure that semantic HTML elements are used appropriately, enhancing the accessibility and SEO of the website.
##Logical Structure:

When inspecting the structure of HTML elements, verify that they follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. This ensures ease of navigation for all users, including those using assistive technologies.
##Accessible Alt Attributes:

When examining icon and image elements, ensure that they include descriptive alt attributes. This ensures that users who cannot view images can still understand their content, improving accessibility.
##Sequential Heading Attributes:

When inspecting heading attributes, verify that they are organized in a sequential order. Proper heading hierarchy not only aids in accessibility but also improves readability and SEO.
##Concise Title Element:

When reviewing the title element, ensure that it is concise and descriptive. A clear title enhances SEO and helps users understand the content of the webpage.
##Getting Started:
To ensure that the marketing agency website meets accessibility standards, follow these steps:

##Clone the Repository:
Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd marketing-agency-website
Review HTML Codebase:
Open the HTML files in your preferred text editor or IDE. Review the codebase to ensure it meets the acceptance criteria outlined above.

##Verify Semantic HTML Elements:
Inspect the HTML elements to ensure proper usage of semantic tags such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer>.

##Check Logical Structure:
Verify that the HTML elements follow a logical structure that is independent of styling and positioning. Use tools like browser developer tools to inspect the DOM structure.

##Ensure Accessible Alt Attributes:
Confirm that all image and icon elements include descriptive alt attributes. Alt attributes should convey the purpose or content of the image to users who cannot view them.

##Validate Heading Attributes:
Ensure that heading attributes (<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, etc.) are used in sequential order according to the content hierarchy. Avoid skipping heading levels for accessibility and SEO reasons.

##Review Title Element:
Verify that the title element of each webpage is concise and accurately describes the content of the page.

##Make Necessary Adjustments:
If any issues are found during the review process, make the necessary adjustments to the HTML codebase to ensure compliance with accessibility standards.

##Test Accessibility:
Use accessibility testing tools or browser extensions to further evaluate the accessibility of the website and address any remaining issues.

##Commit Changes:
Once all necessary adjustments have been made, commit your changes to the repository and push them to the remote branch.

##Deployment:
Deploy the updated codebase to the production environment to make the accessibility optimizations live on the marketing agency website.
